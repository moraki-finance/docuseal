# Docuseal

A lightweight API connector for docuseal.

:warning: The extracted API objects don't do input parameters validations. It's a simple faraday wrapper that allows you to send as many inputs as you want. The docuseal API might fail when passing a wrong set of parameters.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `docuseal` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add docuseal

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install docuseal

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
